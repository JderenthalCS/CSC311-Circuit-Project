## Summary
An interactive Circuit Editor application using JavaFX for the frontend and Microsoft Azure for the backend. This tool offers a drag-and-drop sandbox where users can design, simulate, and reset basic electrical circuits — inspired by the PhET Circuit Construction Kit. Built as part of a school project, the application provides a modular and scalable platform to teach and test circuit fundamentals like Ohm’s Law, voltage, resistance, and current flow.

## Technologies
* **Jetbrains Intellij** - Primary IDE
* **Java JDK** - Version 17+
* **JavaFX** - Controls, Graphics, FXML frontend
* **CSS** - Stylesheets, Graphics
* **Azure** - Cloud platform for database hosting, authentication, and deployment
