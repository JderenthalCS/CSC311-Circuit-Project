# CSC311-Circuit-Project
An interactive Circuit Editor application using JavaFX for the frontend and Microsoft Azure for the backend. This tool offers a drag-and-drop sandbox where users can design, simulate, and reset basic electrical circuits — inspired by the PhET Circuit Construction Kit. Built as part of a school project, the application provides a modular and scalable platform to teach and test circuit fundamentals like Ohm’s Law, voltage, resistance, and current flow.
