//Each component needs to connect to another(or else whats the point). Ex. a battery(2 connections ports) will connect to a
//lightbulb(also 2) via a wire(2 ports) SOOOOOOOO each component here will have ports with connections
//  in between other ports. so YEAH, this class will take care of that
//Each connection should have the following:
//- a unique id
//- sourceComponenetID( the ID of the component that this connection is coming from)
//- sourcePortID (the ID of the port where theconnection is coming from)
//- targetComponentID( same thing as source but, yanno, for the target)
//- targetPortID( that stuff ^^ up there but target)

public class Connection {
}
